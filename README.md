# DECO3500
Project for DECO3500

There are 5 demos in this project, M5Stack have 4 demos, which have 2 different version(Python and UIflow), and Lilypad has 1 demo.

Two M5Stack devices have different Mac addresses, so we need to identify each other by their Mac address(the lasd two code are 3d and f9).

M5Stack demo was created by UIflow, and Lilypad demo was edited by Arduino.

M5Stack device needs two IDEs to implement the code, one is M5Stack Burner, and another is M5Stack UIflow. Download these two IDEs through the link below at first.
